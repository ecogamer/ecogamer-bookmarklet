### Initial Setup
Create a local development bookmarklet using the "bookmarklet-local.js" file. Use this bookmarklet instead of the regular one when doing development as this one points to your local files. To make the bookmarklet copy/paste the file content into the URL or Address field for a new bookmark. Alternatively you can click and drag the file (once downloaded/cloned locally) into your bookmark toolbar.

### While Developing
For convenience a server and grunt watch task have been set up. For the local bookmarklet to work you must be running this task in the command line:
`grunt dev`
