## How to Contribute

### Developer Requirements
Grunt - http://gruntjs.com/getting-started

### Initial Setup
Create a local development bookmarklet using the "bookmarklet-local.js" file.

To make the bookmarklet copy/paste the file content into the URL or Address field for a new bookmark. Alternatively you can click and drag the file (once downloaded/cloned locally) into your bookmark toolbar.

### While Developing
* For the local bookmarklet to work you **must** be running this task in the command line: `grunt dev`. This tasks runs grunt watch and connect, which recompiles files and runs a web server accessible via http://localhost:8000
* Use the local development bookmarklet created in the intial setup instead of the regular one when doing development as this one points to your local files.
